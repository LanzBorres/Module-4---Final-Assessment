# Project: Degen Token (ERC-20)

This project introduces the Degen Token (DGN), a virtual currency built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 standard. DGN empowers players within the gaming ecosystem by enabling a range of actions:

Own, Transfer, and Manage: Players can acquire DGN tokens, hold them in their wallets, and send them to others.
Unlocking Features with DGN:


# Playing with Degen Tokens

Once the contract is live, you can use these features to manage your DGN tokens and access in-game goodies:

1. Earning Tokens (for Admins):  Only admins can create new DGN tokens with the mint function. These can be used as rewards for players.

2. Sending Tokens: Players can share their DGN tokens with others using the transferTokens function.

3. Buying In-Game Items:  The redeemTokens function lets you spend your DGN tokens on awesome items in the store! Just pick the item by number (1-5) and pay the corresponding DGN amount.

4. Checking Your Balance:  Use the standard balanceOf function (available in all ERC-20 tokens) to see how many DGN tokens you own.

5. Burning Tokens (Optional): If you have DGN tokens you don't need anymore, you can permanently remove them from circulation using the burnTokens function (but be sure this is what you want to do!).
